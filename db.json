        "description": "As is traditional for trainee witches, thirteen-year-old Kiki leaves home with her black cat named Jiji, with whom she talks. She flies on her broomstick to the port city of Koriko. While searching for somewhere to live, Kiki is pursued by Tombo, a geeky boy obsessed with aviation who admires her flying ability.  In exchange for accommodation, Kiki helps Osono, the kindly and heavily pregnant owner of a bakery. She opens a Witch Delivery Business, delivering goods by broomstick.",
